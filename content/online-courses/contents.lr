I have re­cently de­cided to of­fer *Python for Designers* on­line courses which are based on this man­ual. This type of so­lu­tion eases many lo­gis­ti­cal prob­lems and al­lows me to reach a broader au­di­ence. The courses also pro­vide fi­nan­cial help for additional project developments.

The *Python for Designers* on­line course is struc­tured in eight classes of three hours each. Dur­ing each ses­sion, I will ex­plain the con­cepts, toss some code around and perform practice ex­er­cises. The course will guide you through the con­tents of the man­ual (and more) fo­cus­ing on strat­egy and prob­lem-solv­ing skills . You will have two hours be­tween each class for completing as­sign­ments. Re­sources and so­lu­tions will be shared via Slack work­space.

The course is meant for be­gin­ners with no prior cod­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, operating in the fields of de­sign and art (or any field deal­ing with im­ages, re­ally). If you al­ready know the fundamentals of pro­gram­ming and Python but you want to increase your skills fur­ther, get in touch and we will arrange some­thing up for you.

The en­roll­ment costs €400 in­clud­ing taxes. If you are a com­pany re­sid­ing out­side Italy, you won’t be charged 22% VAT. For the first batch, I am giv­ing away a 10% launch dis­count 😌. Each course has a min­i­mum of 5 and a max­i­mum of 10 par­tic­i­pants.

To enroll please click on the “sub­scribe” but­ton and complete the form. Shortly af­ter I will send you an in­voice with details for the payment. You’ll be able to pay with Credit Cards (through Stripe), Paypal or Bank Transfer.
