*Writing a book is an adventure. To begin with, it is a toy and an amusement;
then it becomes a mistress, and then it becomes a master, and then a tyrant. The
last phase is that just as you are about to be reconciled to your servitude, you
kill the monster, and fling him out to the public.* â€” Sir Winston Churchill

I would have never thought that a quote from a Tory Prime Minister would make his appearance on these premises. I found it in the preface of *Essential Math for Games and Interactive Applications*; I immediately felt sympathy for the authors.

Writing any manual is quite an undertaking, especially if done during free time. And this is a bit of an unusual publication. I didn't want to wait for years before finish it and therefore share it with my students, so I decided instead to publish a "work in progress" manual. For this reason, I chose not to print the content into a book and to keep it adjustable for the time being. Moreover, I also preferred to release the content myself instead of going through a publisher to keep control over it.

There are many subjects that I would like to address in the future. Here is a short list; feel free to propose something in this GitHub issue.

+ Colors
+ Matrix Transformations
+ Dealing with time and dates
+ BezierPath()
+ FormattedString()
+ Mechanical Curves
+ Linear and 2d Interpolation
+ Interpolation in multiple dimensions
