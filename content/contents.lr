welcome: Welcome to Python for Designers
---
intro: This manual is an introduction to [Python3](https://www.python.org/) and [DrawBot](http://www.drawbot.com/). It covers some language and programming basics as well as a good share of the DrawBot API. If you are looking for a gentle introduction to programming and you are often busy with drawing stuff on a screen, this is maybe the right place for you!

leftBoxTitle: Online Courses
---
leftBox: This manÂ­ual is free to read and free from ads (and it will be like this forever). In order to sustain its development, I offer [online courses](/online-courses) taught in English. You will get a proper introduction to Python and Drawbot plus support in solving coding exercises. Check them out and let me know!
