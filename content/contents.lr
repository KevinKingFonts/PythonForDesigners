welcome: Welcome to Python for Designers

intro: This manual is an introduction to [Python3](https://www.python.org/) and [Drawbot](http://www.drawbot.com/). It covers some language and programming basics as well as a good share of the Drawbot API. If you are looking for a gentle introduction to programming and you are often busy with drawing stuff on a screen, this is maybe the right place for you!

leftBoxTitle: Support
---
leftBox: This manual is open-source, free to read and free from ads. There are a couple of ways to support my work other than money. First of all, you can spread the word on social media and help me reach a broader audience. Or, you can help me to organize a Python+Drawbot workshop in your city.
